# Friends Proposal Project README

## Overview

This README document provides an overview of the `friends_proposal.Rmd`, an R Markdown document dedicated to analyzing the dialogue from the TV show "Friends". This document is part of a broader research project that explores various linguistic and sentimental aspects of the series, focusing on how different characters express themes of love, success, and other emotions.

## Project Structure

The R Markdown document includes several key components:

-   **Introduction**: Overview of the project's goals, the significance of "Friends" as a cultural phenomenon, and the specific research questions the project aims to answer.
-   **Research Questions**: Detailed exploration of the questions guiding the analysis.
-   **Literature Review**: Summary of previous research related to the linguistic and narrative analysis of "Friends".
-   **Code**: Segmented and annotated R code that performs data scraping, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
-   **Data Description**: Explanation of the raw and processed data used in the analyses.

## How to Use This Document

To utilize the `friends_proposal.Rmd` effectively, please follow these steps:

1.  **Download Required Files**: Ensure that you have all necessary files, including the raw data files from which the quotes are scraped. The main file needed is `friends_quotes.csv`, which can be obtained via the included R code.
2.  **Install Required R Packages**: The analysis requires several R packages such as `rvest`, `dplyr`, `stringr`, `purrr`, and `plotly`. These can be installed using `install.packages("package_name")`.
3.  **Run the R Markdown File**: Open the R Markdown file in an RStudio environment and run the chunks sequentially. Each section is independent but requires previous sections' data transformations.
