# Friends TV Show Dialogue Analysis

Welcome to the analytical exploration of dialogue in the acclaimed TV series "Friends." This project, curated by Sixuan Li, Haoran Yang, Wenyang Cao, and Wenling Zhou, is part of the coursework for APANPS5205: Applied Analytics Frameworks and Methods II.

Here we dissect character interactions, dialogue frequency, and sentiment throughout the series, providing insights into the narrative structure that contributed to its lasting popularity.

## Repository Overview

-   `data`: Includes raw data scraped from the official scripts and the processed dataset for analysis.
-   `pics`: Contains images and visuals utilized in our analytical reports and presentations.
-   `plots`: Consists of plot images that represent the key findings from our analysis.
-   `presentation`: Contains slides prepared for presenting our project's findings.
-   `proposal`: Holds the initial project proposal which laid the groundwork for this comprehensive analysis.
-   `project`: Includes the `friends_project.rmd`, the R Markdown file detailing our analysis workflow, methodology, and insights.
-   `README.md`: The document you're currently reading that guides you through the repository.
-   `friends.R`: The R script that encompasses both the data cleaning process and the detailed analysis.

## Data Exploration

-   `friends_quotes.csv`: The sanitized and structured dataset ready for analytical deep-dives.

## Initial Proposal

-   `proposal/friends_proposal.html`: Our original project proposal that set the stage for this in-depth dialogue analysis. It outlines our objectives, proposed methods, and the direction for our research.

## In-Depth Project Analysis

-   `project/friends_project.rmd`: For a complete and in-depth analysis, step into our `project` folder. The R Markdown file, `friends_project.rmd`, is a detailed narrative that interweaves our analytical process with findings and visualizations. From sentiment analysis to dialogue distribution, this document serves as a capstone to our project, illustrating the transformative journey from raw data to insightful narratives.

-   This repository is structured to not only showcase our findings but also to enable enthusiasts and researchers to replicate or extend our study. The `project` folder is the heart of our analytical expedition, containing all the narratives, code, and commentary that piece together the complex dialogue interactions of the "Friends" characters.

## Visual Narratives and Analysis Insights

The `plots` directory is your visual storyboard, capturing the essence of our data-driven narratives. It contains carefully crafted plots that bring our analysis to life, from vibrant word clouds to evocative sentiment graphs. These visuals distill complex data into accessible insights, providing a glimpse into the emotional undertones and character dynamics that have made "Friends" an enduring classic.
